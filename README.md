# CS569 - Web Application Development II
## Final Project 
### Application specifications 
Build an application that will help establish skilled workers offer their services to other people in their community/city. Only authenticated users will be able to use to the system. The idea is to allow users within the same city to communicate, ask for services, and/or provide the service.
### General use case and requirements
* Every user has a profile page, shows their name, address, contact information (this helps users to reach each other easily).
* User 1 needs help installing their new wireless router. They set a price they are willing to pay. User 2 has experience with gadgets and networking devices. They would accept the job offer of User 1.
* Another scenario is when User 2 submits a post about providing networking services for specific amount of fees, and User 1 finds this post and request a service at certain date/time.
* Users can browse two categories of posts: "Work Requests" or "Work Providers" tabs in their city only (based on the city of their profile). 
* Homepage displays posts of 25 results per page, and button to display "More...".
* Users can change their city to a different one from a list of states/cities to browse posts from other areas.
* Posts are ordered by date (newest first) and expire after 48 hours.
* Users can communicate by posting comments (Q/A)  to any post.
* *Optional: Design Service-Side-Events (SSE) notification system to notify post owners and commenters when any comment is posted (2 extra points added to your final course grade).*
      
*Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting any code as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden and will result to receiving NC for the course. Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.*
  
### Submission Requirements:
Please make sure you prepare the following requirements before your presentation:  
* A paper with your backend/frontend architecture. The backend architecture includes all your REST entities and routes. The frontend architecture includes your modules, what each module has (components, directives, and services) and how they are all connected.

**Deadline and presentation on Wednesday, December 15th, starting at 10:00 AM**
