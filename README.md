# CS569 - Web Application Development II
## Final Project 
### Application specifications 
Build an application that will help establish connections between people in a community/city. Only authenticated users will be able to post to the system. The idea is to allow users within the same city to communicate, ask for services, and allow volunteers to provide the service.
### General use case and requirements
* User 1 needs the backyard lawn to me mowed.
* User 2 has a lawn mower and would like to contribute helping their community.
* Users can browse "Service Needed" or "Service Provided" tabs in their city. 
* Paginate posts in 25 results per page.
* Users can change their city to a different one.
* Posts are ordered by date and expire after 24 hours.
* Users can communicate by sending comments to any request. 
* Notify post owner and commenters when any comment is posted.
      
**Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden. Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.**.

Please make sure you submit the following requirements:  
* A paper with full details about your backend/frontend architecture.
* A client Angular application and Express server.

**Deadline and presentation on Wednesday, June 9th, 10:00 AM**
