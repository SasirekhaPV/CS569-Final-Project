# CS569 - Web Application Development II
## Final Project 
### Application specifications and requirements
Build an application that will help establish connections between people in a community/city. Only authenticated users will be able to post to the system. The idea is to allow users within the same city to communicate, ask for services and allow volunteers to provide the service.
### General use case
* User 1 need their lawn to me mowed.
* User 2 has a lawn mower and would like to contribute helping their community.
* Users can browse all "Service Needed" or "Service Provided" tabs in their city. 
* Users can change their city to a different one.
* Posts are ordered by date and expire after 24 hours.
* Users can communicate by sending comments on the any request. 
* Notify post owner and commenters when any comment is posted.
      
**Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden. Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.**.

* A paper with full details about your backend/frontend architecture.
