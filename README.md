# CS569 - Web Application Development II
## Final Project 
**This is an individual project.**
### Application specifications and requirements
This final project is a combination of research and implementation for OpenID connect protocol. You will submit both a paper and code implementation that allow users to authenticate with a third-party service provider.
      
**Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden. Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.**.   
  
Project will be evaluated based on your code quality (not quantity). I may need to schedule meetings with some students to discuss their code-source.  

## Submission Requirements:
Please make sure you submit following requirements:  
* A paper with full details about the steps you followed to authenticate users with the service provider.
* A client Angular application that authenticate users with your choice of any service provider.

**Deadline is Thursday, June 18th, 12:30 PM** 
  
**Good luck and happy coding!**
