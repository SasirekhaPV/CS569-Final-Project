# CS569 - Web Application Development II
## Final Project 
**This is a group project.**
### Application specifications and requirements
Build an application that will help rebuilding connections with people within a community. Only authenticated users will be able to post to the system. The idea is to allow users within the same city to communicate ask for services and have others volunteer to provide the service.
### General use case
* User 1 need their lawn to me mowed.
* User 2 has a lawn mower and would like to contribute helping their community.
* Users can browse all "Service Needed" or "Service Provided" tabs.
* Either users should be able to post a request to "ask for/provide" the service, at the same time either ones can communicate by sending comments on the request.
* Requests should expire after 5 days period.
      
**Remember to respect the code honor submission policy. All written code must be original. Presenting something as oneâ€™s own work when it came from another source is plagiarism and is forbidden. Plagiarism is a very serious thing in all American academic institutions and is guarded against vigilantly by every professor.**.   
  
Project will be evaluated based on your code quality (not quantity). I may need to schedule meetings with some students to discuss their code-source.  

## Submission Requirements:
Please make sure you submit following requirements:  
* A paper with full details about your backend/frontend architecture.
* A client Angular application and Express server.

**Deadline is Wednesday, June 9th, 10:00 AM** 
  
**Good luck and happy coding!**
